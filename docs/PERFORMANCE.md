# Testing and performance report

## Functional verification

Run the local suite with the Go version in `go.mod`:

```sh
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
node --check web/app.js
```

API integration tests use temporary SQLite databases. The suite covers registration/auth, media ownership, video editing, equal-timestamp Feed cursors, interaction transitions, resumable upload recovery and expiry, direct/group WebSocket delivery, offline replay, presence, outbox retries/dead letters, and Prometheus output. `feed_cache_test.go` uses an in-process Redis-compatible server to check cache hits, mutation invalidation, and database fallback; it does not measure real Redis performance. A Chrome check also verified group creation, a live WebSocket connection and persisted group history after reopening the conversation.

## Measured in-process Feed baseline

On 2026-10-20, `BenchmarkTimelineFeed1000` ran on Linux/amd64 under WSL with Go 1.27.2 and an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H. The benchmark seeds 1,000 published videos in a SQLite in-memory database and issues complete `GET /api/feed?scene=timeline&limit=20` handler calls. Command:

```sh
go test ./internal/platform -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkTimelineFeed1000$' -benchtime=2s -count=3 -benchmem
```

| Run | ns/op | B/op | allocs/op |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 358,682 | 92,999 | 881 |
| 2 | 362,115 | 92,827 | 881 |
| 3 | 373,384 | 92,844 | 881 |

This measures one process and one in-memory SQLite dataset, including HTTP handler work and JSON serialization. It does not measure network throughput, MySQL, cache behavior, QPS or P95. It is a baseline for comparing later Feed changes.

## Load-test procedure

Start the API with a representative dataset. Then install k6 and run:

```sh
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 SCENE=timeline VUS=10 DURATION=30s k6 run tests/load/feed.js
```

Repeat with `SCENE=following`, `recommend`, and `hot` after preparing suitable users and videos. Record CPU, memory, SQLite/MySQL settings, data size, host, Go version, k6 version, request rate, P50/P95/P99, and error rate. Use the output to determine whether query indexes, SQL plans, connection pools, Redis caching, or hybrid fanout are warranted.

## Results

No k6 or MySQL load test has been run for GoStream yet. Docker CLI in this WSL session reports that Docker Desktop WSL integration is disabled; k6 is unavailable. No QPS, P95, cache hit rate or cross-node performance figure is claimed.
